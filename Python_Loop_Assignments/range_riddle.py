Task 1: Your Mood Today
Write a program that prints off different moods for each day of the week. Create a list of moods such as "Happy", "Sad", "Energetic", and "Calm". Using the range() function, loop through the days of the week and for each day, randomly select a mood from the list and print it. Ensure that your program includes the use of the random module to select the mood.
